I am excited to apply for the DevOps Engineer position at JP Morgan, as advertised on your website. With over 5 years of applied experience in DevOps and a formal training certification, I am confident that my technical expertise and leadership skills make me a strong candidate for this role.

As a DevOps Engineer, I have a proven track record of executing creative solutions and technical troubleshooting. I pride myself on thinking beyond routine or conventional approaches to build solutions or break down technical problems. My hands-on practical experience with Jenkins, Java, Microservices, and JKP, coupled with my advanced knowledge in automation tools and infrastructure support, allow me to develop secure and high-quality production code. I am also adept at reviewing and debugging code written by others, and identifying opportunities to eliminate or automate remediation of recurring issues to improve overall operational stability of software applications and systems.

In addition to my technical abilities, I have a strong skill set in leading team members through technical processes. I am passionate about driving communities of practice across DevOps to promote awareness and use of new and leading-edge technologies. I enjoy leading evaluation sessions with external vendors, startups, and internal teams to drive outcomes-oriented probing of architectural designs, technical credentials, and applicability for use within existing systems and information architecture. Furthermore, I am committed to adding to team culture of diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect.

I am proficient in automation and continuous delivery methods, and I am excited to learn more about the cloud technologies, specifically AWS, which is a preferred qualification for this role.

Thank you for your consideration. I am eager to bring my skills, experience, and passion to your team and contribute to the continued success of JP Morgan.

Sincerely,
